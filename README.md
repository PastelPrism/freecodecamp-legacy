# 🚀 Projects from freeCodeCamp (legacy) 

Hi! 👋 

In **April 2025** I got challenged to do **every web development course** we could find. A challenge I happily accepted. 🎉
And this project is part of that challenge. 

This is the main project folder for all the projects from three freeCodeCamp (legacy) courses. 

## 🎓 Curriculum Overview  

The freeCodeCamp **Legacy Curriculum** I chose to do consists of three main tracks with real-life projects, these courses are: 

### **1️⃣ Responsive Web Design** *(HTML & CSS)*
This course has the following Certification Projects:

1. [Build a Survey Form](https://pastelprism.github.io/freecodecamp-legacy/responsive-web-design/survey-form/) 🏗️ *for now a placeholder template*
2. [Build a Tribute Page](https://pastelprism.github.io/freecodecamp-legacy/responsive-web-design/tribute-page/) 🏗️ *for now a placeholder template*
3. [Build a Technical Documentation Page](https://pastelprism.github.io/freecodecamp-legacy/responsive-web-design/technical-documentation/) 🏗️ *for now a placeholder template*

Every project comes with **extra challenges** from my teacher who reviews my projects.
For this one it was building 5 different templates to keep as a placeholder for as long as I'm working these projects.
These templates can be found in the **Responsive Web Design** folder. 
Every project will come with it's own extra challenge and Readme 🥰

If you think you can help me through all of this, for comments, feedback or just to cheer me on.
