Hi! 👋

Welcome to this very unfinished README. 
This README has hope it will be finished one day.
I think that's lovely of it 😊 I'm sure the "Hi!" with wavy hand will stay, but the rest...?

Anyway, the assignments: 

Create a survey-form with the following requests:

The survey-form should contain a header, paragraph with an explanation of what the survey is about. 
It requires the following input fields: - A name 
                                        - an e-mail address including an HTML5 validation error
                                        - age; this field should only accept numbers 
All of the input fields requires corresponding labels, placeholders and ID's
After that, the form should contain a dropdown element, checkboxes, radiobuttons and a text area for additional comments 
The Survey-form should end with a Submit button. 

As an extra challenge I have to make it look like it's written on a painting including a frame  - right... no idea yet.
First the original assignment, which is going to be a survey about not writing on paintings I guess, it's just not the right thing to do. It's not. 
 
Oh, and I should finish this README. 

The end. 🐣
