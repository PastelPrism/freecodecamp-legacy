        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Muse</strong> are an <strong>English rock band</strong> from
          <strong>Teignmouth, Devon</strong>, formed in 1994. The band consists
          of <strong>Matt Bellamy</strong> (lead vocals, guitar, keyboards),
          <strong>Chris Wolstenholme</strong> (bass guitar, backing vocals), and
          <strong>Dominic Howard</strong> (drums, percussion).
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Muse</strong> released their debut album,
          <strong>Showbiz</strong>, in 1999, showcasing Bellamy's falsetto and a
          melancholic alternative rock style. Their second album,
          <strong>Origin of Symmetry</strong> (2001), incorporated wider
          instrumentation and romantic classical influences and earned them a
          reputation for energetic live performances.
          <strong>Absolution</strong> (2003) saw further classical influence,
          with strings on tracks such as
          <strong>"Butterflies and Hurricanes"</strong>, and was the first of
          seven consecutive <strong>UK number-one albums.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          Black Holes and Revelations (2006) incorporated electronic and pop
          elements, displayed in singles such as "Supermassive Black Hole",[1]
          and brought Muse wider international success. The Resistance (2009)
          and The 2nd Law (2012) explored themes of government oppression and
          civil uprising and cemented Muse as one of the world's major stadium
          acts. Topping the US Billboard 200, their seventh album, Drones
          (2015), was a concept album about drone warfare and returned to a
          harder rock sound. Their eighth album, Simulation Theory (2018),
          prominently featured synthesisers and was influenced by science
          fiction and the simulation hypothesis. Their ninth album, Will of the
          People (2022), which combined many genres and themes from their
          previous albums, was released in August 2022.
        </p>

        <p>
          Muse have won numerous awards, including two Grammy Awards, two Brit
          Awards, five MTV Europe Music Awards and eight NME Awards. In 2012,
          they received the Ivor Novello Award for International Achievement
          from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors. As of
          October 2022, they had sold more than 30 million albums worldwide.
