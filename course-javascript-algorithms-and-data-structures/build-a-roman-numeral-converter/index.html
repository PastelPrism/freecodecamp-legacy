        <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This sort of template is developed for study purposes only, (and for fun). The assignment was to make a simple template with a disclaimer, just to fill up some empty project folders. Anyway, this page is going to be a project for the freeCodeCamp "Responsive Web Design" course (legacy curriculum, that is). Because I got challenged to do every web development course out there! (Yes, that is possible ((maybe))). This template is created just to be a placeholder, meant for study purposes rather than serious interpretation. If youâ€™re reading this, Hello! This is an empty template. But if you have any feedback or comments, I totally understand. In that case you can reach me <a href="mailto:amy-van-leeuwene@eproton.me">here</a>.
